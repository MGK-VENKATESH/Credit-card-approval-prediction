# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Approval Prediction App

This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether a credit card application is likely to be **approved or denied** based on user input. The app is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** and is intended for educational purposes.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help visualize how machine learning models can be used in decision-making scenarios, such as credit risk assessment. The model is trained on a dataset containing applicantsâ€™ demographic, financial, and employment information, and uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict credit approval.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle:

ðŸ“Ž **[Credit Card Approval Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction)**  
- `application_record.csv`: Contains personal and financial information of applicants  
- `credit_record.csv`: Contains historical credit behavior over time

> ðŸ’¡ Credit goes to [Rikdifos on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rikdifos) for the dataset.
