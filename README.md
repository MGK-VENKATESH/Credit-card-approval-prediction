# 💳 Credit Card Approval Prediction App

This project is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts whether a credit card application is likely to be **approved or denied** based on user input. The app is built using **Python**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit** and is intended for educational purposes.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help visualize how machine learning models can be used in decision-making scenarios, such as credit risk assessment. The model is trained on a dataset containing applicants’ demographic, financial, and employment information, and uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict credit approval.
